# This Workflow builds an artifact with Fast DDS installed.
# This is used by other workflows in this and other repositories to avoid compiling Fast DDS every time is needed.
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#  This workflow takes a .repos file from "./.github/workflows/configurations/fastdds/dependencies.repos" (in this same repository) and downloads the repositories included.
#  Then uses the colcon.meta files in "./.github/workflows/configurations/metas/<os>/colcon.meta" to the build projects.
#  Finally it takes the install directory generated from colcon build and uploads it as an artifact.
#  This is done for several OS and cmake built types:
#    - ubuntu-22.04 | ubuntu-20.04 | windows-2019 | windows-2022
#    - Debug | Release
#
# ARTIFACT RESULT:
#  The artifact generated is called "built_fastdds_<os>_<cmake_build_type><postfix>"
#    - <os> is "ubuntu-20.04", "ubuntu-22.04", "windows-2019", or "windows-2022"
#    - <cmake_build_type> is "Debug", or "Release"
#    - <postfix> is "_nightly" for scheduled runs every night, or is set manually by the user.
#
# SCHEDULE:
#  This workflow runs every night at 00:00 using latest version of Fast DDS (master).
#
# MANUAL RUN:
#  Running this workflow manually, the following arguments might be set:
#
#   built_configuration_branch: set a branch to download dependencies.repos and colcon.meta files from
#                               this repository [Default: main]
#
#   artifacts_name_postfix:     set the postfix name for the uploading artifact [Default: _manual]
#                               Note: do not use "_nightly" in this argument, or other workflows may be affected
